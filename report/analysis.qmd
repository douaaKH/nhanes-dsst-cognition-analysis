## Research Question and Introduction

### Research Question

What factors are associated with cognitive functioning among adults aged 60 years and older in the United States?

### Introduction

Cognitive functioning is a key component of healthy aging and is closely linked to independence, quality of life, and overall well-being among older adults. Declines in cognitive performance are associated with increased risk of disability, institutionalization, and mortality, making the identification of factors related to cognitive health a public health priority [@rivan2021cognitive].

Cognitive functioning in later life is influenced by a complex interplay of demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, physical, and mental health factors. The goal of this analysis is to explore associations between cognitive performance and a broad set of variables among U.S. adults aged 60 years and older, using data from a nationally representative health survey. This report is **exploratory and iterative in nature** and will be updated as the project progresses.

::: callout-note
This is a preliminary and evolving analysis. The literature review is not intended to be exhaustive, and modeling decisions (including weighting and missing data handling) will be refined in future versions.

## Data Source and Sample

### Data Source

Data for this analysis come from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013–2014 cycle**, a cross-sectional survey designed to assess the health and nutritional status of the non-institutionalized U.S. population.

### Study Sample

The analytic sample includes **adults aged 60 years and older** who participated in the cognitive function component of NHANES. The working dataset contains 1785 participants.

At this stage, analyses are conducted on the unweighted sample. **Survey weights will be incorporated in later modeling stages** to produce population-representative estimates and to appropriately account for the complex survey design.

## Outcome: Cognitive Function

### Digit Symbol Substitution Test

Cognitive functioning is assessed using the **Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)**, a widely used neuropsychological test administered in NHANES as part of the cognitive function examination for older adults [@jaeger2018digit].

The DSST measures general cognitive performance, such as:

-   Processing speed

-   Sustained attention

-   Working memory

Participants are asked to match symbols to numbers according to a key within a fixed time limit. The final score reflects the **number of correct matches**, with higher scores indicating better cognitive performance.

In NHANES 2013–2014, DSST scores range from **0 to 133**, with observed scores in this sample spanning a narrower range typical of older populations. The DSST is particularly sensitive to age-related cognitive changes and has been shown to predict functional decline and mortality in older adults [@rosano2008association].

## Candidate Predictors and Related Literature

A broad set of variables were selected based on prior evidence linking demographic characteristics, lifestyle behaviors, health, and chronic conditions to cognitive function. The literature review guiding variable selection is **intentionally brief and non-exhaustive**, serving primarily to motivate exploratory analysis.

### Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors

-   Age [@salthouse2010]

-   Gender [@mcCarrey2016]

-   Marital status [@fratiglioni2004]

-   Educational attainment [@stern2012]

-   Income-to-poverty ratio [@jefferson2011life]

### Lifestyle Behaviors

-   Alcohol consumption [@anstey2009alcohol]

-   Smoking status [@peters2008smoking]

-   Physical activity / recreational activity [@erickson2011]

-   Sleep duration [@yaffe2014connections]

-   Diet quality (self-reported) [@arikawa2025cognitive]

### Physical and Cardiometabolic Health

-   Body mass index (BMI) [@fitzpatrick2009]

-   Blood pressure / hypertension indicators [@iadecola2016]

-   Diabetes status [@biessels2006]

-   Cardiovascular conditions [@gorelick2011]

### Mental and Neurological Health

-    Depression symptoms (PHQ-9 score) [@ganguli2006depressive]

-    History of stroke [@pendlebury2009]

These variables were drawn from NHANES **Demographic**, **Questionnaire**, and **Examination** components.
